\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The \hyperlink{class_scene_bounds}{Scene\+Bounds} class is a special kind of gem describing the bounds of scene. The shape of the bounds is a cube, with a given extent in each direction.  The main reason that the bounds are also a gem is easier collision detection. If there are bounds around our scene every ray emitted into scene will hit something. Furthermore the collision with scene bounds can be processed in a way, that the player will lose if the player hits the bounds. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
