\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The \hyperlink{class_camera}{Camera} class provides view and perspective projection matrices. Additional the viewport of camera is stored.  The view of camera has to be specified by eye, center and up or by position, viewdirection and up. It is allowed to mix both definitions, but it might lead to unexpected behaviour. The perspective projection is specified by field of view, viewport, and near and far plane. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
