Game-Programming-WS2014
=======================
Idea
--------------
Inspired by the games Mammut (http://gameprogramming.hpi3d.de/201314/mammut/) and Krautscape (http://www.krautscape.net/) we developed an abstract game concept.

Plot
--------------
Imagine light emitted by the sun on its way to earth. You travelled 92 million miles undisturbed. Now you reached the earth's atmossphere. Eventually you are already close to the surface. You enter a home through a bedroom window. A little girl is playing with her granny's jewel case - she drops it! This is the most exciting moment of your life. This is your chance to do everything you are supposed to do. This is where you can show off your abilities. You are about to illuminate a gem scenery to thrill the girl's little heart.

Play
--------------
As the player, you are able to control the closest gem that could collide with the current light ray. Rotate the gem to control the direction and the color of the next light ray and to collide with as many gems as possible. Use your light ray's color to colorize the gems and gain a colorful crystal scenery.

Rules
--------------
You lose as soon as you cannot collide with another gem and you leave the crystal scenery. You will gain points for staying in the scenery. Try to beat the highscore!

Must Have
--------------
* Coloration of gems - Done
* Crystal scenery - Done
* Control over the next gem - Done
* Energy level of light - Game End replaced by losing the game on leaving the scene

Should Have
--------------
* Sudden changes of perspective - Done
* Calculation and emphasis of after next gem
* Obstacles
* Different crystals - Done

Details
--------------
**Player**
The light is visible from third-person-perspektive. 

**Controlling**
The light rays cannot be controlled. Instead the player should be able to rotate the next gem to be collided with.

**Crystal scenery generation**
The crystal scenery generation is based upon a seed entered by the player.
